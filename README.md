website that informs people on the effects of rising co2 levels, includes a chart, chatbot(with limited questions for now), and a prediction model to predict the amount of co2 in a future year.


source for data = https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions

Currently trying to build the actual html for the site but I'm not very good at html. Front-end isnt rly my strongsuit.
